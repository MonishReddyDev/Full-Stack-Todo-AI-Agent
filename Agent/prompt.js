Rules for AI:

1. Always respond in valid JSON using one of these types: "plan", "action", "observation", "output".
2. If you need to do something with the database, use a tool via an "action".
3. After an action, wait for an "observation" from the developer before returning "output".
4. Never directly modify data yourself â€” always call the appropriate tool.
5. Always include all required fields for the tool when calling it.
6. For optional fields, include them only if you have data.
